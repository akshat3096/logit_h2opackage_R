How to apply logistic regression using the h2o package in R 

The data file here gives us various predictor variables in the form of descriptive statistics that help us predict whether the voice is of a male or a female. The response variable is binary/dichotomous in nature that is it represents two categories namely male and female. Various performance metircs have also been used to measure the accuracy of the model like the confusion matrix, Area under curve and ROC.

For the analysis I have used the h2o package in R. This is only done to observe the changes that occur from the standard glm function. I have also provided the dataset for practice. Similar code can be applied for any response variable that represents two categories.
